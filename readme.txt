Since i have used relative path while coding, The html files will be generated in the publishedfiles folder inside x64 folder
 if the project is run using run.bat
else it will be generated in publishedfiles folder inside the CodeanalysisMain directory

If collapse doesnt run on IE initially please go to the directory in which the files were created and try. OR Run using Google Chrome.
